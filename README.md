Neural Network Implementation from Scratch
This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple feedforward neural network from scratch, without using any deep learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). The implementation includes:

Forward pass

Backpropagation

Training using gradient descent

Dataset
Dataset: [MNIST / Iris / Custom Dataset]
